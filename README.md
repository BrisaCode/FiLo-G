With an high probability, there is already something like this. Anyhow, I think it would be interesting to develop this, just for fun.<br/>
This program refreshes your computer/server every X seconds. Let's say you have a server and you want some files to be constantly refreshed, you can select what you want to be refreshed and the program will to this for you.
The only difference between dropbox and this program, is that you can choose which files you want to be refreshed, and the protocol to be used is ftp.
